# Afro-Latin-Society-ALS-


## Overview
In October 2019, several minority alumni returned to celebrate the African-Latino  Society (ALS) and the Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) 50th  Anniversary. After meeting in the ALS Room that evening with current students, alumni heard familiar themes of concern, such as: lack of cultural sensitivity training in  residential life, issues of racism and bias, and a deep disconnect from the institution.  In this climate of addressing social injustice experienced within our country, a global  pandemic, and the promise of working collectively to create change—we ALS Alumni look to create a partnership with the institution to assist the College’s walk toward its  new theme “Progress.”
